# tic attack toe

This project was my most recent multiplayer game and finally eneded my quest for the most basic multiplayer solution in JavaScript [peer.js](https://peerjs.com/). The great thing about using peer.js was the blazing fast speed I was able to pull with my free-plan servers. The game itself taught me a bunch about proceadural JavaScript graphics and it has no actual assets. Instead the entire game runs off of the JavaScript canvas. I did not relize it at the time but most of the rendering, movement, and camera concepts here would make up [crown.js](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS)

> Play here at: https://tic-attack-toe-nrlh.onrender.com/ it will probably take a while for the server to spin up.
